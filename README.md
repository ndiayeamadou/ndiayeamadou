ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

Iâ€™m Amadou from Senegal âœ¨. I'm a software developer.
Passionate about computer development, motivated, I push the limits of my skills every day through research.
I learn new techniques and ways of doing things.
ðŸŒ± I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like PHP, Laravel, Livewire, Vue.JS, Symfony, etc.
